<h1>Kruptar plugins coding</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>.<br />
This manual documents how to use Kruptar (current version 7.1.1.17), and describes principles of writing plugins for that tool (focused mainly on C language).<br />
Kruptar - is a tool for extracting and inserting text, widely used in romhacking and fan translation. Main purpose is to extract, edit, insert text and automatically recalculate pointers in one application, which is easily extendable by plugins for any compression support. Kruptar also supports DTE/MTE schemes natively. By analogy, this is like Atlas and Cartographer in one nice GUI with extended pointers schemes and full plugins support.<br />
Written by Djinn a.k.a. Kusharami, latest version can be found at <a href="http://magicteam.net/index.php?page=programs">magicteam</a> - Russian fan translation group. Hereinafter I will sometimes refer to Russian websites and at your will, please use online <a href="https://translate.google.com/#ru/en/">translation services</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kruptar options</strong>.<br />
First things first, Kruptar has great GUI, which is self-explanatory. Here I will clarify a few not so obvious things in short.<br />
Project creation is straightforward: you specify source/destination ROMs and tables, create group, specify places in ROM, which can be used for text storage, add list of pointers, by choosing pointer scheme, options and pointer table offsets. Right after that, Kruptar extracts string corresponding to each pointer and you can save project file.<br />
Kruptar stores its project in *.kpx file, which is zip archive. Inside you will find all tables, which you have previously loaded in project, changed script in *.txt and *.kdt - binary file, which stores group/list names, offsets, options etc.<br />
After editing strings you, can press Recalculate and Insert button for text insertion.<br />
And now, the options:<br />
All numerical options can have ‘h’ before the value, for assigning it as hexadecimal.</p>
<pre><code>kpCodePage: ??? 
	Specifies code page, Kruptar will use for text.
kpFlags:
	Value 0-3 (2 significant bits). 
	Set low bit - do not display string terminator in Kruptar. Script 
	will look more straight, and CLRF code will be inserted as usual.
	Set high bit - do not delete 3 last symbols in the end of the 
	entry.
	If you have dictionary group all entries will have terminator as 
	last 3 symbols (i.e. '/00'). By default, this symbols are deleted
	by Kruptar, and you can discard that by this option.

Tables: 
	You can load a table from separate file. Encoding is defined by BOM
	for UTF. Or you can specify &quot;CP#&quot; in the beginning of script/table 
	file, where # represents encoding number.
	Kruptar supports single-byte entries, multi-byte entries, 
	multi-character entries and combinations of these two. 
	CLRF codes should not have any '=' signs after byte, and you can 
	specify &quot;\n&quot; as a part of character entry.
	String terminators should go after special word 'ends'. 
	e.g.:
	41=A
	42=Box
	439A=C
	445A096C=Dammerung
	45=E\n
	46=F
	FF
	ends
	00
	Atlas and Cartographer rather than Kruptar, additionaly support 
	non-normal entries: control codes (with parameters) and table 
	switching.
grPlugin:
	Specifies plugin for that separate text group.
grIsDictionary:
	Makes that group dictionary. That affects some display features 
	(affected by kpFlags = 2) and some dictionary options become 
	available.
ptDictionary:
	Specifies dictionary group for DTE/MTE scripts.
ptPointerSize:
	Size of pointer in bytes. Can be 0 for scripts without pointers, 
	just specify first and last strings offsets during 'Add Pointers'.
ptReference:
	stringOffset = ptReference + pointerValue
	Signed integer.
ptInterval:
	Space in bytes between two separate pointers in pointer table. 
	Integer. If ptSplittedPtrs is false, must be &gt; 0.
	See ptSplittedPtrs for additional information.
ptAlignment:
	String offset force-alignment. This affects pointer value, of 
	course.
	Integer, must be &gt; 0.
ptShiftLeft:
	Pointer[i].value &lt;&lt;= ptShiftLeft; During extraction.
	Integer, must be &gt;= 0.
ptCharSize:
	Specifies character size in original encoding for proper extraction.
	Integer, must be &gt; 0.
ptStringLength:
	Length of fixed-length strings. If length is 0, Kruptar searches for 
	string terminators. If both ptStringLength and ptPointerSize are zeroed, 
	just specify ROM's text block first and last bytes offsets during 
	'Add Pointers'.
ptBIG_ENDIAN:
	Pointer's endianness. For bytes swap, see ptSplittedPtrs.
ptSplittedPtrs:
	Space in bytes between bytes in one pointer, specified in ptInterval. 
	For example, cases, when pointer 
	value is in operands of two commands, or High and Low parts of 
	pointer are stored in different tables.
	4 bytes pointers are splitted at 2 and 2 bytes parts, 3 byte 
	pointers are splitted to 1 byte Hi part and 2-byte Low part.
	For byte swap set ptInterval &lt; 0, for instance: 4 byte pointer 
	word-swap can be achieved with set ptSplittedPtrs and ptInterval = -2.

ptSNESlorom:
	For SNES LoROM images proper pointer recalculation.
ptAutoPtrStart:
	ptReference = PointerTableOffset; No need to fill ptReference. 
ptAutoReference:
	stringOffset[i] = ptReference + Pointer[i].value + Pointer[i].offset; 
ptPtrtoPtr:
	Pointer to pointer to string. Both pointers must have the same format.
	Kruptar does not support multi-level pointers hierarchy yet.
ptSeekSame:
	During insertion, same strings will have the same pointer. 
	No redundancy in text space.
ptNotInSource:
	Specifies group of strings, which was not previously in original ROM 
	(added by translator).

Right mouse button click on corresponding List gives you opportunity to select
Fix pointers positon:
	If you have changed pointer scheme somehow (for instance, 
	ptDestPtrSize became 4 because text volume has increased), this 
	recalculates pointer position for a new scheme.
Reset TBL links:
	Resets table links for all strings in group.
Near-Pointer Variables:
	This data can be represented as variables near pointers. 
	The size is specified in ptInterval.</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Kruptar plugins</strong>.<br />
Using described above options you can easily edit almost any plain script just with standard Kruptar. As Kruptar (naturally) does not provide interface for pointers modification, there are two cases when you want to write a plugin for Kruptar:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Some script features, like unencoded blocks of binary data inside script’s body or some optimizations when you just want text to look perfectly plain without raw special symbols inside script.</li>
<li>Any text compression, while pointers are still stored in a plain way without bit packing or modification in a structure. Any other cases are feasible within Kruptar, for instance:
<ul>
<li>NES Battletoads - script is compressed with Huffman and pointer value stores bit position in the stream, to start unpacking with. You can specify one pointer-to-pointer table, which will be passed to plugin. Process pointer table in Kruptar and add pass appropriate amount of unpacked strings to Kruptar. On insertion phase you should then recalculate pointers in plugin, pack start bits in them and write text and pointers via plugin.</li>
<li>Wii Metroid Prime - script elements with pointers are compressed with LZO. You can pass one pointer to packed stream in your plugin, unpack, add strings to Kruptar and pack everything back via plugin. Still it would be more natural to write separate application only for decompression/unpacking, and edit unpacked file in turn with Kruptar. Next, I will describe few coding examples for effective plugin.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Compilation and debug<br />
Kruptar uses plugins even in general plaintext cases. Default plugin is Standard.kpl - gets offset to the string, searches for a line terminator and copies one string to Kruptar’s buffer. Plugin is just a compiled dll, of course. Natively it should be created with Delphi. For some examples of Delphi plugin coding you can check <a href="http://magicteam.net/?page=documents&amp;show=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F%20Kruptar%207">this</a>. Delphi - is the commercial proprietary IDE and Kruptar is written in it. That will be the issue: Kruptar uses ‘sharemem’ unit for memory share with it’s plugins. Even dlls, compiled with Free Pascal are not compatible with Kruptar, as Delphi string has to be managed by the Delphi runtime. In addition, Delphi uses Object Pascal dialect, which means, we have to rewrite in Pascal open-source C code for compression process, for instance. Our target - is to create fully functional GCC compiled Kruptar plugin. And here is the plan: we’ll compile an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_design_pattern">adapter</a> plugin in Delphi, which will transmit data between our gcc dll and Kruptar. This adapter is named ‘c_plugin.kpl’, it can be found in zip archive below this section and should be placed in Kruptar’s Lib directory. At Kurptar’s load, plugin asks for a path to dll, we created with gcc. During project creation, c_plugin.kpl is specified in grPlugin and extraction/insertion is committed now via our code.<br />
It is time to open up code for our examples <a href="https://github.com/Grivr/Kruptar_C_Plugins">here</a> or <a href="../../files/Kruptar_C_Plugins.zip">here</a>.<br />
All examples can be compiled with MinGW. Setting up environment, gcc and gdb usage is beyond this document’s scope. I will just explain few tricks.<br />
In Makefile you can find:<br />
<code>$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -shared -o $(TARGET).dll $(TARGET).o -Wl,--kill-at</code><br />
<code>&quot;--kill-at&quot;</code> is a must for any Delphi host application because of function <a href="http://www.willus.com/mingw/yongweiwu_stdcall.html">decorations</a>. Otherwise, mandatory functions, like “GetEncodeSize” will be decorated to “GetEncodeSize@4” by compiler and c_plugin.kpl will not accept your plugin dll.<br />
<code>&quot;-shared&quot;</code> is needed for every dll, of course.<br />
For debug, I prefer to use standard gdb attaching to host application, as Kruptar is not open source anyway (and will not be in the foreseeable future).</p>

<li><p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample<br />
For starters, I will make a simple project for binary file with ASCII encoding, filled with 1-byte pointers and two NULL-terminated strings. Whole Decode code is mainly dynamic array realization in C - I set up a source pointer to ROM + string offset and keep copying bytes to my str[] untill I find ‘0’ terminator.<br />
At the end I do <code>tStringAdd(str,strlen(str))</code> and my str gets copied to Kruptar’s memory.<br />
GetEncodeSize first gets string from Kruptar by <code>data-&gt;tStringGet(index, pStrSize)</code>. tStringGet returns NULL if there are no more strings at given index, assigned to current pointer, so I loop through all indexes. Inside I realloc global for my dll output buffer to fit another string and copy whole string to buffer, also calculating global encodeSize.<br />
By the time Encode is executed, I have already filled outBuffer and it is still stored in dynamic memory. Moreover, Kruptar has already allocated memory for output buffer at size, returned by GetEncodeSize. So I just make memcpy(buffer, outBuffer, encodeSize) and Kruptar pastes this buffer at the right place in ROM.<br />
Kpx project is self-evident and you can learn everything just watching what options have been set in it.</li>
<li><p>Standard<br />
That will be the absolute analog for Standard.kpl, written in C. As an example I have took NES Final Fantasy, which actually uses DTE. Do not worry: the DTE itself will be handled by Kruptar’s table support feature - all DTE entries are single byte and stored in table. All plugin needs to pass is byte string, which will be then decoded by Kruptar.<br />
And yes, I’ve tricked you a little: code wise standard plugin is absolutely the same as sample one. No surprise here: you still have to look through rom for an end of string, copying bytes until then. In Encode phase, Kruptar will find optimum code for DTE entry and return byte, which our plugin will copy to output buffer. I have included that in archive for the sake of Final Fantasy kpx file.</p></li>
<li><p>Heimdall<br />
Sega CD Heimdall game uses sort of advanced script format with some binary data in it. For example, first byte of some strings is ‘0’, and strings are NULL-terminated, which means with our previous code some of the strings will not be added to Kruptar. In case of Atlas/Cartographer, we could add byte chunks with ‘0’ in *.tbl as multibyte table entries. This will not work with Kruptar. Eventhough it also supports multibyte entries, Kruptar doesn’t use table at all during initial strings parse from ROM, when string lengths are calculated. Here we will have to write separate plugin. Just to copy first byte of the string and search for line termiator in rest part at Decode phase:<br />
<code>data-&gt;tStringAdd(str, size);</code><br />
not <code>strlen(str)</code>, as we had in previous examples, because C’s strlen will also take string length up to 1st ‘0’ symbol, which means string, which starts from ‘0’ will have length 0 and will not be fully added to Kruptar. You can check contents of kpx file for detailed information of script structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Snake’s Revenge<br />
Good old 6-bit encoding for text - Kruptar plugin is intended for such things. It was pretty well described in my previous document for Kruptar’s plugins coding in Delphi, and here I just rewrote this code into C and compiled in plugin (“-s” compiled dll is 3 times smaller than Delphi’s kpx). You can also check code details in foresaid sources. I have also included kpx file for script structure understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>Langrisser<br />
That game for Sega Genesis has few tricks in script. Firstly, each string starts with 3 bytes, which should be presented in editable form. Secondly, every line must start at even address in ROM. Script also uses MTE scheme for names, so translator will never guess what line length does current line have. All that issues can be handled by simple plugin for Kruptar. I’ve converted first 3 bytes into string sequence between bracket symbols ‘[]’ by standard snprintf. Now script will look like “[197e5a]Damn! I`m beaten…/FF/FF”. First bytes now can be easily encoded back by sscanf. Of course, script table should not contain symbols of brackets.<br />
For the second script feature, I’ve implemented simple byte stream with pushOut function. Every time, when plugin finds new line char of end of string, it checks the line length. It should be odd, so next line could start with even address. If it’s not, plugin pushes additional 0x7F byte into output stream, which, apparently, means nothing and can be used as a dummy. Kruptar also passes data already encoded with MTE, so no additional code for MTE handle should be implemented in plugin.<br />
For detailed explanation, you should definitely check out code at github or in archive (which also contains kpx file).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>That concludes Kruptar plugins theme. If I was not detailed enough or you have additional questions, feel free to ask them in the form below.</p><hr />
