	    <p><a href="https://github.com/romhack/BC-BackFromSource">Battle City - Back From Source</a> was updated: fixed respawn time overflow after 42nd Level and Life bonus, taken by enemy now works correctly. Enemy counter at the right side is also updates accordingly. Thanks a lot to Max Silver for testing. Small page design fix was also done.</p>

	    <p>Previous version of my CMS (pages were hosted at griever.magicteam.net) was written by me in PHP. Interested one can find it <a href="https://github.com/romhack/griever.magicteam-CMS">here</a>. The time has come to move to a static generated site. These pages were generated with <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> and have many advantages, compared to my PHP CMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety. I’ve written PHP CMS as my absolutely first project in PHP. I won’t be surprised if it had multiple security vulnerabilities. God forgive me for risking my translation group’s server.</li>
<li>Speed. GitHub Pages is served with Nginx and automatically gzip’s content. No need to make minimalistic pages with poor design.</li>
<li>Markdown. All my previous design experience can be expressed with one sentence: “put everything in &lt;pre&gt;, make it look like in notepad”. Now I’m not so radical. Lists, headings and code highlight make user experience better.</li>
<li>Revision control system. Pages are just another <a href="https://github.com/romhack/romhack.github.io">Github repository</a>. Pages history can be found anytime, no backups needed.</li>
<li>Page availability time. GitHub is self-explaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve also added some Disqus and <a href="./rss/">Atom feed</a> for your convenience. Hopefully, all pages are still valid as strict XHTML. Pages are rewritten into markdown in a short time, so there still can be some errors. Please let me know, if you’ll find them.</p>
        </li>

	    <p>﻿Wow, that’s been a while since my last activity here. I have no excuses - just real life and work :) I will not promise anything global here, especially as the RSS channel is still running. If you’re interested, just subscribe. I have cleared design - tutorials look better now everywhere, except IE. I don’t want to make a mess in HTML code for the sake of IE compatibility. More pages now meet all W3C markup requirements. And yes, I have switched to English. Use Google translate if necessary. For today brief <a href="./doc/kruptarPlugins">document</a>, which describes Kruptar’s plugin writing process in C.</p>
