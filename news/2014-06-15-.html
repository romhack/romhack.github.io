<p>Previous version of my cms (pages were hosted at griever.magicteam.net) was written by myself in php. Interested one can find it here. The time has come to move at static generated site. These pages were generated with Hakyll and have many advantages, compared to my PHP cms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety. I’ve written PHP CMS as my absolutely first project in PHP. I won’t be surprised if it had multiple security vulnerabilities. God forgive me for risking my translation group’s server.</li>
<li>Speed. GitHub Pages is served with Nginx and automatically gzip’s content. No need to make minimalistic pages with poor design.</li>
<li>Markdown. All my previous design experience can be expressed with one sentence: “put everything in &lt;pre&gt;, make it look like in notepad”. Now I’m not so radical. Lists, headings and code highlight makes user experience better.</li>
<li>Revision control system. Pages are just another Github repository. Pages history can be found anytime, no backups needed.</li>
<li>Page availability time. GitHub is self-explaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve added some Disqus for discussions. Hopefully, all pages are still sctrictly valid as HTML 4.01. Pages are rewritten into markdown in a short time, so there still can be some errors. Please let me know if you’ll find them.</p>
