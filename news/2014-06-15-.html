<p>Previous version of my CMS (pages were hosted at griever.magicteam.net) was written by me in PHP. Interested one can find it <a href="https://github.com/romhack/griever.magicteam-CMS">here</a>. The time has come to move to a static generated site. These pages were generated with <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> and have many advantages, compared to my PHP CMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety. I’ve written PHP CMS as my absolutely first project in PHP. I won’t be surprised if it had multiple security vulnerabilities. God forgive me for risking my translation group’s server.</li>
<li>Speed. GitHub Pages is served with Nginx and automatically gzip’s content. No need to make minimalistic pages with poor design.</li>
<li>Markdown. All my previous design experience can be expressed with one sentence: “put everything in &lt;pre&gt;, make it look like in notepad”. Now I’m not so radical. Lists, headings and code highlight make user experience better.</li>
<li>Revision control system. Pages are just another <a href="https://github.com/romhack/romhack.github.io">Github repository</a>. Pages history can be found anytime, no backups needed.</li>
<li>Page availability time. GitHub is self-explaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve also added some Disqus and <a href="/rss/">Atom feed</a> for your convenience. Hopefully, all pages now are valid as HTML 4.01 strict. Pages are rewritten into markdown in a short time, so there still can be some errors. Please let me know, if you’ll find them.</p>
