<p><a href="https://github.com/romhack/BC-BackFromSource">Battle City - Back From Source</a> was updated: fixed respawn time overflow after 42nd Level and Life bonus, taken by enemy now works correctly. Enemy counter at the right side is also updates accordingly. Thanks a lot to Max Silver for testing.</p>
<p>Small page design fix was also done.</p>
