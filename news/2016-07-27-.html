<p>﻿Some small page design updates again. Nothing special to tell about, but I’m still with the scene: as a long-delayed finish, I’ve written some compression tools for <a href="http://forum.goldensunhacking.net/index.php?topic=2624.15">‘Golden Sun’</a> (GBA) and <a href="http://chief-net.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=39">‘Jewel Master’</a> (Genesis). Both had sophisticated compression schemes and ‘Golden Sun’, basically, was my personal long-term arch-enemy.</p>
<p>I also code some tools for smaller games in Haskell, all of them will be placed at <a href="https://github.com/romhack">my github page</a>.</p>
